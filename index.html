Growth hormone deficiency</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Growth hormone deficiency</h1>
<h3><marquee>This condition occurs when your pituitary gland, a pea-size structure at the base of the brain, doesn’t make enough growth hormone. This hormone controls development of the body’s bones and organs. Children with untreated growth hormone deficiency (GHD) are shorter than their peers and have other symptoms.</marquee></h3>
<img src="im.jpg" class="Image">
<h3 class="third"> SYMPTOMS:</h3>
<p>With GHD, you may have symptoms such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fatigue</li><li>
Sleep problems</li><li>
Bone loss</li><li>
Muscle weakness</li><li>
Weight gain, especially around the belly</li><li>
Thinner skin</li><li>
Low motivation</li></ul>


<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Congenital GHD is present at birth because of a genetic defect passed down by one or both parents. Subtypes IA, IB, IIB and III are linked to different genetic defects and how they are passed down. </li><li>
Acquired GHD can be present at birth, or it can develop later in childhood or adulthood. This type is caused by damage to the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, the brain structure that controls the pituitary gland. The cause of the damage may be a head injury, a brain tumor, an infection, or surgery or radiation therapy to treat a tumor or another condition.</li><li>
Idiopathic GHD has an unknown cause.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Exam: We will start with a physical exam and ask you about your symptoms.</li><li>

Other tests, called stimulation tests, help us measure GH levels. If your levels don’t reach expected numbers during the test, it could indicate a GH deficiency.</li><li>

Insulin tolerance test: We inject you with insulin to lower your blood sugar. Low blood sugar sends a message to the pituitary gland to release GH. We take blood samples over a couple of hours to check GH levels. This test produces reliable results, but because it relies on lowering blood sugar, it can result in more discomfort for patients than newer stimulation tests.</li><li>

Glucagon stimulation test: We inject glucagon into an arm muscle to increase your body’s production of GH. We take blood samples a few times over about three hours to check levels.</li><li>

Macimorelin stimulation test: In this test, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017, you take macimorelin (brand name Macrilen) in a drink to stimulate GH production. We check blood samples four times over 90 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="third">TREATMENT</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Injection: You inject yourself every day with a small needle. We’ll help you become comfortable with this.</li><li>

Side effects: When you first start the medication, you may have muscle or joint aches, and mild swelling from fluid retention. They usually improve after we adjust your dose to the right level for you.</li><li>

Monitoring: We test your levels and adjust your dose as needed, to control side effects and improve your well-being. We’ll make sure you don’t get too much GH, which can lead to muscle or joint pain, headaches and blurry vision.</li><li>

Effects of treatment: The goal of GH replacement therapy is to improve your health and reverse GHD features, such as belly fat and low bone density. Many patients see significant benefits from GH replacement. They may gain improved bone density, greater ability to exercise and improved well-being.</li>
